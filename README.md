# Binary-UI

Binary-UI is a set of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components that implement
[Cards' Binary Design](https://try.cards) specification.

### Fira Sans Font

Binary-UI was designed with the [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)
font. Be sure to include it in your project. Get this font from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Fira+Sans)
or Mozilla:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.cdn.mozilla.net/fonts/fira.css">
```
