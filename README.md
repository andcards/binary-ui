# Binary UI

A set of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components that implement [Cards](https://try.cards) Binary Design specification.

Binary Design's core values are functionality and minimalism. We deconstruct design down to functional elements, with the following principles in mind:
- Symbols are more powerful than words.
- Design element must have a function.
- The function should be absolutely necessary.

Read about [iconography](/packages/binary-ui-icons/README.md), design of [components](packages/binary-ui-components/README.md) and [styles](/packages/binary-ui-styles/README.md).

## Fira Sans Font

Binary UI was designed with the [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)
font. Be sure to include it in your project. Get this font from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Fira+Sans)
or Mozilla:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.cdn.mozilla.net/fonts/fira.css">
```
